# Welcome to the Space Turtle Webring!
In this webring, you can find a collection of drawings depicting Space Turtles
visiting Earth with something to say.

## Why Space Turtles?
The Space Turtle idea was thought up by
[the Green brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_brothers)
on their podcast
[Dear Hank and John](https://complexly.com/shows/dear-hank-john)
as a community event where people could either submit a drawing of a
Space Turtle or the words a Space Turtle could be saying upon visiting Earth,
and the drawings and text would be paired together.

## What's a webring?
A webring is a list of websites that are linked together in a circular
structure. There usage dates back to the early days of the internet before
search engines were widely adopted and when there were no big social media
platforms with discovery algorithms. Webrings were ways for people to discover
new sites by clicking through links on websites that people

## How does this webring work?
By the power of community! And also JavaScript! Since it would take a lot of
coordination to constantly ask folks to update the links on their website
every time a new site gets added/removed from the webring, a little snippet
of code was written by Gus (with the help of a few resources) to look up
a single file hosted on GitHub to determine which links should go before and
after each site. This means that after the code is added to someone's website,
all the heavy lifting regarding link management will be handled automatically!
It also means that anybody can submit a request to add their site to the
webring by submitting a pull request at the
[Space Turtle GitHub Repo](https://github.com/GusBusDraws/space-turtle-webring).
If you'd like some help adding your site to the webring,
you can also email Gus at smallwebsubway at gmail dot com.

## The Smallweb Subway
This project is a branch of my (Gus's) Smallweb Subway project, which is an
experimental project that seeks to connect communities online in a way that is
more human that large social media platforms by offering a sense of place to
the internet. The term "small web" or "indie web" refers to hobby websites
maintained by one person or a small team for purposed other than trying to sell
things. The subway system theme is used as a metaphor and as a way to make the
internet feel connected and like something that can have neighborhoods!

This is a work in progress, so right now the Smallweb Subway is only made up
of a single line (webring), but eventually I plan to add more interest-based
lines and a map to visualize the connectivity of the lines.
